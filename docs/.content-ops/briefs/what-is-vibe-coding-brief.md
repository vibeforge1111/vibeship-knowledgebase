## 2. Topic Research

### Origin of "Vibe Coding"
**Coined by:** Andrej Karpathy (former Tesla AI Director, OpenAI founding team)
**When:** February 2025
**Original Tweet/Post:** Described coding by "vibes" - giving AI rough direction and iterating

### Karpathy's Definition
"There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists... I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works."

### Key Characteristics of Vibe Coding
1. **AI-First:** The AI writes most/all code
2. **Intent-Driven:** Describe what you want, not how to build it
3. **Iterative:** Rapid back-and-forth with AI
4. **Non-Expert Accessible:** Don't need to understand the code deeply
5. **Speed-Focused:** Ship fast, fix later

### Who Are Vibe Coders?
- **Non-technical founders** building MVPs
- **Designers** creating functional prototypes
- **Developers** accelerating their workflow
- **Hobbyists** building side projects
- **Students** learning through building

### Vibe Coding vs Traditional Coding
| Aspect | Traditional Coding | Vibe Coding |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Code Writing | Human writes code | AI writes code |
| Knowledge Required | Deep language expertise | Basic understanding + clear intent |
| Process | Plan → Code → Debug | Prompt → Generate → Iterate |
| Speed | Hours/days for features | Minutes/hours for features |
| Understanding | Must understand every line | Trust AI output (mostly) |
| Debugging | Read and fix code | Describe issue to AI |
