## Implementation Notes

1. **Data Integrity**: All articles must use external sources (CWE, OWASP, NVD, PortSwigger, academic research) with proper citations. No fabricated statistics.

2. **AI Focus**: Each article should explain WHY AI tools generate this vulnerability pattern specifically.

3. **Vibe Coding Audience**: Non-technical founders using Cursor, Claude Code, Bolt, v0, Replit. Plain English explanations required.

4. **Template**: Use vulnerability-brief.md template for full briefs.

5. **Internal Linking**: Each new article should link to 3-5 existing vulnerability articles and 2-3 tool articles.
