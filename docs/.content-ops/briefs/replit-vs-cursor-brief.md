## 5. Security Deep Dive

### Replit Security Profile
**Cloud Security Model:**
- Your code lives on Replit's servers
- Subject to Replit's data policies
- Potential exposure in breaches
- Replit employees technically have access

**Strengths:**

- Code stays on your machine
- You control access
- No third-party code storage (for editing)
- Traditional IDE threat model

**CVE-2025-62352: Path Traversal**
- Can access files outside project
- Fixed in recent versions

**Considerations:**
- Your local security matters
- No built-in secrets management
- Need external deployment (more attack surface)

### Comparative Analysis
| Risk Factor | Replit | Cursor |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Data Residency | Cloud (Replit) | Local (your machine) |
| Code Exposure Risk | Higher (cloud storage) | Lower (local) |
| Secret Management | Better (built-in) | Manual |
