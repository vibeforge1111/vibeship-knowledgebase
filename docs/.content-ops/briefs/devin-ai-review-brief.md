### Competitive Gap
Existing Devin reviews are either:
1. **Overly promotional** - miss the 15% success rate reality
2. **Pure hype criticism** - don't give actionable guidance on when Devin works

## Content Outline

### Quick Answer (50 words max)
Devin AI achieves a 15% success rate on complex tasks based on real-world testing. At $500/month (Team tier), it's worth it only for high-volume migration/refactoring work where you've validated Devin works for your specific use case first. Most vibe coders get better ROI from Cursor ($20/mo) or Claude Code.

### Section 1: What is Devin AI?
- Cognition Labs' autonomous AI software engineer (launched March 2024)
- Works independently via Slack/chat interface, has its own browser and terminal
- Designed for complete tasks, not just code completion
- Real-world analogy: hiring a remote junior dev who works 24/7 but needs extensive review
- Consequences of the hype: $2B+ valuation, significant controversy over marketing claims
- Word count: 120-150

### Section 2: The Real Numbers - How Accurate is Devin?
- SWE-bench benchmark: 13.86% (vs 1.96% previous best) - but this only tests Python bug fixes
- Answer.AI real-world test: 14 failures, 3 successes, 3 inconclusive from 20 tasks
- Trickle testing: 15% success rate on complex tasks
- The pattern: Devin excels at well-defined, repeatable tasks but fails on ambiguous work
- Quote from Answer.AI: "Tasks it can do are those so small and well-defined that I may as well do them myself, faster, my way."
- Word count: 180-220

### Section 3: What Devin Actually Does Well
- Migration projects: Nubank case study (12x efficiency on ETL migrations)
- Bulk refactoring with clear patterns
- API integrations with well-documented services
- Web scraping and data extraction
- Building SaaS prototypes (reported: 2 days vs 1 week)
- Key insight: Devin works when you can teach it a pattern once, then repeat
- Word count: 150-180

### Section 4: Where Devin Fails (Don't Use It For These)
- Complex recursive functions (creates infinite loops)
- Third-party library dependency resolution
- Ambiguous decision-making scenarios
- Security reviews (hallucinated issues in testing)
- Debugging existing code (tunnel vision on wrong causes)
- Research tasks beyond basic documentation
- When to walk away: if task requires contextual judgment or cross-repo understanding
- Word count: 150-180

### Section 5: The Security Problem with Autonomous Agents
**This section is our differentiator**
- Data exfiltration risks: telemetry can include proprietary code
- Supply chain attacks: agents may fetch compromised dependencies
- Code injection: shell access without sanitization
- Vulnerability introduction: AI reproduces insecure patterns from training data
- Specific Devin security note: Full GitHub, AWS, CI/CD access means high blast radius
- What to do: sandbox environments, code review gates, restricted permissions
- Link to: autonomous agent security article (if exists) or prompt injection
- Word count: 200-250

### Section 6: Devin Pricing Breakdown - Is $500/Month Worth It?
- Core: $20/mo minimum + $2.25/ACU (about 9 ACUs for $20)
- Team: $500/mo with 250 ACUs included ($2/ACU)
- Enterprise: Custom pricing, VPC deployment, SSO
- What's an ACU? Compute for task completion - varies by complexity
- Cost example: Complex SaaS feature might use 5-10 ACUs ($11-22)
- ROI calculation: 250 ACUs/month = ~25-50 substantial tasks
- Break-even: need to save 12+ engineering hours/month to justify Team tier
- Word count: 180-220

### Section 7: Devin vs Alternatives - Decision Matrix
| Use Case | Best Tool | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| Daily coding | Cursor | Faster, cheaper, stays in your IDE |
| Complex refactoring | Claude Code | Better reasoning, cheaper |
| Bulk migrations | Devin | Teach once, repeat many times |
| Quick prototypes | Bolt/Lovable | Faster for simple apps |
| Autocomplete | GitHub Copilot | Best integration |

- When Devin wins: You have 50+ identical tasks and can validate success pattern first
- When Cursor wins: Variable tasks, interactive development, tight budget
- When Claude Code wins: Terminal power users, complex reasoning needed
- Word count: 200-250

### Section 8: Who Should (and Shouldn't) Use Devin
**Use Devin if:**
- You have repetitive migration/refactoring work (100+ similar changes)
- You can invest time teaching Devin your patterns
- You have strong code review processes
- Budget allows for experimentation ($500+/mo)
- You treat it as a force multiplier, not replacement

**Skip Devin if:**
- You're a solo founder or small team on tight budget
- Your work is varied (different task types daily)
- You need real-time pair programming experience
- Security is paramount and you can't sandbox properly
- You expect it to "just work" without supervision

Word count: 150-180

### Section 9: The Controversy - Is Devin a Scam?
- March 2024 demos criticized as cherry-picked
- YouTuber exposed Upwork demo as misleading (didn't match customer requirements)
- Real capability vs marketed capability gap
- Cognition's response: improved with Devin 2.0, slashed pricing
- The verdict: Not a scam, but overhyped. Real tool with real limitations.
- Word count: 120-150

## Stats Box Data

```
15%     | Success rate on complex tasks (Answer.AI testing)
13.86%  | SWE-bench benchmark score
$500    | Team tier monthly cost
250     | ACUs included in Team plan
12x     | Efficiency gain on migrations (Nubank case)
70%     | Task failure rate in real-world testing
```

## Code Examples Needed

### Pattern 1: What Devin Does Well - Migration Task
```python
# The type of task Devin excels at:
# Repeatable pattern across many files

# Before: Old SQLAlchemy model
class User(Base):
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = Column(String(255))

# After: Migrated to Prisma
# Devin can do this across 100+ models after seeing one example
model User {
  id    Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String @db.VarChar(255)
}
```
Explanation: Devin works best when you can show it a transformation pattern once and have it repeat across many files.

### Pattern 2: Security Risk - Autonomous Agent Shell Access
```javascript
// Risk: Devin has shell access and can execute commands
// Unsanitized input could lead to command injection

// What autonomous agents might generate:
exec(`npm install ${userProvidedPackage}`);

// The risk: Supply chain attacks if package names aren't validated
// Mitigation: Sandbox environments, allow-lists, human approval gates
```
Explanation: Autonomous agents with shell access introduce attack vectors that don't exist with assistive tools like Cursor.

## Notes for Writer Agent

### Tone Guidance
- **Skeptical but fair**: Don't trash Devin, but don't oversell it
- **Data-driven**: Always cite specific numbers and sources
- **Practical**: Focus on when to use it, not whether it's "good" or "bad"
- **Security-conscious**: VibeShip readers need the security angle competitors miss

### Technical Accuracy
- Be precise about pricing: $20/mo Core vs $500/mo Team are different products
- ACUs are variable - don't promise specific task counts
- SWE-bench limitations are important context for the 13.86% claim
- The 15% success rate comes from real testing, not benchmarks

### Things to Avoid
- Don't make it a hit piece - Devin has real use cases
- Don't ignore the controversy - address it directly in section 9
- Don't compare to human developers unfairly - it's meant to augment
- Don't skip security - autonomous agents are different from assistive AI
- Don't use outdated $500 pricing only - mention Core tier too

### Vibe Coding Terms
Use these 3-5 times naturally:
- vibe coding / vibe coders
- vibe coded applications
- AI-generated code
- AI-assisted development

### Persona Recommendation
**Suggested persona**: @waitwhat_ (The Skeptic)

Reasoning: This topic needs a critical, balanced voice that:
- Questions marketing claims with data
- Isn't dismissive but demands proof
- Helps readers see through hype
- Still acknowledges when something works

Alternative: @keystrokecounts (The Optimizer) if focusing on ROI calculations

## Research Summary

### What We Found
1. **Real success rate is ~15%**, not the marketed SWE-bench numbers
2. **Pricing changed dramatically**: Core tier at $20/mo makes testing affordable
3. **Security is under-discussed**: Autonomous agents have unique attack surfaces
4. **Use case matters**: Migrations/refactoring = good; varied work = bad
5. **Controversy was warranted**: Early demos were misleading, but Devin 2.0 is improved

### Our Unique Angle
Most Devin reviews are either hype pieces or takedowns. We're providing:
1. Honest numbers from real testing (Answer.AI, Trickle)
