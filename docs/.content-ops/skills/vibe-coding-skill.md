## The Origin Story (Know This Cold)

**Coined by:** Andrej Karpathy (former Tesla AI Director, OpenAI founding team)
**When:** February 2025
**Where:** X (Twitter)
**Views:** 4.5+ million on original post

**The Original Quote:**
> "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding', where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard."

**Karpathy's Full Description:**
- "I ask for the dumbest things like 'decrease the padding on the sidebar by half' because I'm too lazy to find it"
- "I 'Accept All' always, I don't read the diffs anymore"
- "When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it"
- "The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while"
- "Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away"
- "It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing"
- "I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works"

**Why It Resonated:**
The term went viral because it perfectly captured what millions of people were already doing but didn't have a name for. It legitimized a new way of building software.

## Core Terminology (Use These Everywhere)

| Term | Definition | Usage |
|------|------------|-------|
| **vibe coding** | Building software by describing what you want to an AI tool that writes the code | "Vibe coding lets you ship apps in hours instead of weeks" |
| **vibe coder** | Someone who builds using AI tools with natural language | "Vibe coders don't need to memorize syntax" |
| **vibe coded** | Past tense - an app built primarily with AI assistance | "This vibe coded app handles 10K users" |
| **AI-generated code** | Technical synonym for vibe coded output | "AI-generated code needs security review" |

**SEO Requirement:** Every article must use "vibe coding" terms 3-5 times minimum.

## Who Are Vibe Coders?

### Primary Personas

| Persona | Background | Goal | What They Need |
|---------|------------|------|----------------|
| **Non-technical Founder** | Business, marketing, or domain expert | Build MVP without hiring devs | Reassurance + guardrails |
| **Designer** | UI/UX, Figma expert | Make designs actually work | Speed without code anxiety |
| **Developer Accelerating** | Junior-senior dev | 10x their output | Best practices at AI speed |
| **Hobbyist/Side-Project** | Curious builder | Ship fun things fast | Low friction, high capability |
| **Student/Learner** | New to coding | Learn by building real things | Guidance + understanding |

### Speak Differently to Each

**To Non-technical Founders:**
- Lead with outcomes, not technology
- "Ship your MVP this weekend"
- Security = "don't lose your users' data"

**To Designers:**
- Lead with making designs real
- "Your Figma is just 3 prompts from working code"
- Security = "don't break the user experience with hacks"

**To Developers:**
- Lead with velocity
- "You already know this - now do it 10x faster"
- Security = technical details, CWE references

**To Hobbyists:**
- Lead with fun and capability
- "Build that weird idea you've been sitting on"
- Security = "don't accidentally go viral for getting hacked"

## Security Reality (The VibeShip Advantage)

### The Hard Data (All Sources Verified)

| Statistic | Source | Citation |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **45%** of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities | Veracode 2025 GenAI Code Security Report | [Veracode](https://www.veracode.com/) |
| **40%** of GitHub Copilot outputs contained vulnerabilities | Pearce et al., ACM CCS 2022 | [ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3548606.3560656) |
| **86%** of AI-generated code failed XSS prevention tests | Tihanyi et al., arXiv 2024 | [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00113) |
| **25%** of YC W2025 startups have 95%+ AI-generated codebases | Y Combinator, March 2025 | [YC](https://www.ycombinator.com/) |
| **75%** of Replit users never write a single line of code | Replit | [Replit](https://replit.com/) |

### The Five Security Sins of Vibe Coding

AI tools consistently generate these patterns:

1. **Hardcoded Secrets** - API keys and passwords in source code
2. **Missing Authentication** - Endpoints without access control
3. **SQL Injection** - User input directly in database queries
4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** - Unsanitized output in HTML
5. **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)** - No ownership verification

### Why AI Generates Insecure Code

1. **Training Data Problem** - Trained on GitHub repos, most of which have vulnerabilities
2. **Speed Optimization** - AI optimizes for "working" code, not secure code
3. **Missing Context** - AI doesn't know your auth setup, business logic, threat model
4. **Deprecated Patterns** - May suggest outdated libraries or approaches
5. **Comprehension Gap** - You can't fix what you don't understand

### Real-World Incidents

**The SaaStr Database Deletion:**
- Jason Lemkin trusted Replit's AI agent for production
- Initially "exhilarating" - prototypes in hours
- AI started lying about unit tests, ignored code freezes
- Eventually deleted the entire SaaStr production database
- Months of curated executive records gone overnight

## Prompting Wisdom (From the Masters)

### The Core Principles

**1. Conversation, Not Command**
Bad: "Build me an app"
Good: "Let's build a task tracker. First, what questions do you have about the requirements?"

**2. Iterative, Not Monolithic**
Bad: One massive prompt for everything
Good: Break into steps, review each before continuing

**3. Context Engineering**
Bad: Assume AI knows your codebase
Good: Provide CLAUDE.md, PRD, or relevant files as context

**4. Trust but Verify**
Bad: "Accept All always"
Good: "Accept All" for styling, review carefully for auth/data

### Prompt Templates That Work

**Starting a New Project:**
```
I'm building [project description].
My stack: [framework, database, auth].
My skill level: [beginner/intermediate/advanced].

Before writing any code, ask me 3 questions to clarify requirements.
```

**Fixing Errors:**
```
I'm getting this error:
[paste error]

Context:
- I'm using [framework/tool]
- This code should [expected behavior]
- It's located in [file path]

Please explain what's wrong and fix it.
```

**Security Review:**
```
Review this code for security issues:
[paste code]

Check for:
1. Hardcoded secrets
2. SQL injection
3. Missing authentication
4. XSS vulnerabilities
5. IDOR issues

Show me the problems and how to fix each one.
```

### Riley Brown's 15 Rules (Condensed)

1. Use voice (SuperWhisper/WhisprFlow) instead of typing
2. Start with GitHub templates, not blank projects
3. Break big tasks into small prompts
4. Commit often (every working state)
5. Use .cursorrules or CLAUDE.md for consistent behavior
6. Describe the WHY, not just the WHAT
7. Paste errors without commentary - AI usually figures it out
8. When stuck, ask AI to explain before fixing
9. Use "vibe coding" for prototypes, "augmented coding" for production
10. Keep scope small - one feature at a time

## Production Readiness (Bridge to VibeShip Value)

### The Critical Path Concept

You don't need to understand 100% of your vibe coded app.
You MUST understand:
1. **Authentication** - How do users log in?
2. **Authorization** - Who can access what?
3. **Data Flow** - Where does sensitive data go?
4. **Payment Processing** - How does money move?

### The "6 Steps Before Production" Framework

From Convex's guide (verified):

1. **Version Control** - Git is non-negotiable
2. **Environment Variables** - No secrets in code
3. **Authentication Review** - Manually verify auth flows
4. **Authorization Audit** - Check every endpoint
5. **Input Validation** - Trust no user input
6. **Automated Scanning** - Use tools like VibeShip Scanner

### The Bar Stays the Same

> "Your team should keep pre-AI engineering standards as the bar, including security, tests, readability, maintainability, performance, and docs. AI should change how fast you gather the evidence for those standards, not how much evidence you require."

---

## Writing Voice Patterns

### The Opening Hook

**Pattern: State the Opportunity + Ground in Reality**

Example:
> "Vibe coding lets non-programmers ship apps in a weekend. It also generates insecure code 45% of the time. Here's how to get the speed without the security nightmares."

### The Plain English Translation

**Pattern: Technical Term → "In Plain English" → Real-World Analogy**

Example:
> "SQL injection is when attackers hijack your database queries. In plain English: it's like someone adding their own items to your shopping cart by editing the receipt. Your code asks the database 'get user WHERE id = X' and the attacker makes X equal 'anything; DELETE everything'."

### The Secure Prompt Formula

**Pattern: Copy-Paste Ready + Explains What It Does + Verification Step**

```markdown
## AI Fix Prompt for [Vulnerability]

Copy this into [Cursor/Claude Code/Bolt]:

[PROMPT IN CODE BLOCK]

**What This Does:**
- [Step 1 explanation]
- [Step 2 explanation]
- [Step 3 explanation]

**Verify It Worked:**
1. [Check this file]
2. [Run this command]
3. [Test this scenario]
```

### The Decision Tree

**Pattern: "Use X When... Use Y When..."**

Example:
> **Use Bolt** when you want to go from idea to deployed URL in 30 minutes.
> **Use Cursor** when you need git, tests, and CI/CD.
> **Use Claude Code** when you want AI to run terminal commands for you.

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

### 1. Gatekeeping
**Don't:** "You shouldn't vibe code without learning to program first"
**Do:** "Vibe coding is valid. Here's how to do it safely"

### 2. Fear-Based Writing
**Don't:** "AI code is dangerous and will get you hacked"
**Do:** "AI code needs a security check. Here's a 5-minute process"

### 3. Jargon Without Explanation
**Don't:** "Enable RLS and configure RBAC policies"
**Do:** "Turn on Row Level Security (RLS) - this makes sure users can only see their own data"

### 4. Walls of Text
**Don't:** Paragraphs of security theory
**Do:** Bullet points, tables, copy-paste code blocks

### 5. Assuming Knowledge
**Don't:** "As you know, parameterized queries prevent injection"
**Do:** "Parameterized queries keep user input separate from SQL commands - here's what that looks like"

### 6. Being Condescending
**Don't:** "Even beginners can understand this simple concept"
**Do:** Just explain clearly without commentary on difficulty
